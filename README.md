# RekindleLearning

Congratulations on recieving this demonstration.
I am honered to have had the opportunity to at least present the latest version of Bonsai Version 5.2 with it's flagship development
RekindleLearning
It's result:

Three consecutive coding days.
7999 lines of code.
270 project items
570 lines of code an hour average

A stable start to a great projct. 
The secure navigation system directs the views as imagined. 
The basic screen layout seems to work well and only graphics are required to complete look and feel.
With all data considerations met, API integration well underway.

Integration notes*
Formatting of data dump.
API to DB development.
Existing models.
